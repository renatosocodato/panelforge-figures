| 01 | `rhogtpase_dynamics`        | merged  | — | `v1.1.0-s01` | 6 (12→18) | none | Waddington family retagged heatmap→conceptual; lw=2.4→2.2 to hold ratchet |
| 02 | `fret_biosensors`            | merged  | — | `v1.1.0-s02` | 8 (10→18) | none | Visual-QA polish: dose_matrix callout axes-fraction anchor; windowed_roi legend minimized |
